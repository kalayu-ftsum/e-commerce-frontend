This project is a demonstration of building an ecommerce storefront using Medusa and Next.js, with a focus on frontend development.

## Overview

Ecommerce storefronts play a pivotal role in allowing customers to browse products, make purchases, and engage with businesses online. This project showcases the development of a dynamic and user-friendly storefront, powered by Medusa for backend functionalities and Next.js for frontend rendering and interactivity.


### Why Next.js?
